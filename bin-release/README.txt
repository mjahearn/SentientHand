***********************
Known Technical Issues:
***********************

- Hand launchers aim at a slightly different trajectory than the actual launch.
- Robot bodies extend a laser line beyond the reach of the body and the line does not map 1:1 with the region that the hand will touch.  We hope to resolve this via ray tracing.
- The sound effect for a hand landing on a surface plays when attempting to walk into a wall, which was not intended.

***********************
Known Stylistic Issues:
***********************

- Gameplay and story are not well-integrated as intended.
- Conveyance of level goals are not as uniformly clear as intended, based on play-testers' reactions.
